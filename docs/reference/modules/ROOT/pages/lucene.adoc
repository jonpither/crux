= Lucene

Lucene module for Crux making use of https://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene].

WARNING: This module is in alpha and likely to change. In particular,
we might rationalize/combine the different query functions available
(see https://github.com/juxt/crux/issues/1318).

== Setup

`crux-lucene` runs in-process as part of the Crux node as a Crux module.

First, add the `crux-lucene` dependency to your project:

[tabs]
====
deps.edn::
+
[source,clojure, subs=attributes+]
----
juxt/crux-lucene {:mvn/version "{crux_version}-alpha"}
----

pom.xml::
+
[source,xml, subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>juxt</groupId>
    <artifactId>crux-lucene</artifactId>
    <version>{crux_version}-alpha</version>
</dependency>
----
====


Add the following to your node configuration:

[tabs]
====
JSON::
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "crux.lucene/lucene-store": {
        "db-dir": "lucene",
  }
}
----

Clojure::
+
[source,clojure]
----
{...
 :crux.lucene/lucene-store {:db-dir "lucene-dir"}}
----

EDN::
+
[source,clojure]
----
{...
 :crux.lucene/lucene-store {:db-dir "lucene-dir"}}
----

== Querying

All text fields in a document will be automatically indexed. You can
then you use the in-built `text-search` fn in your datalog:

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e]
 :where '[[(text-search :name "Ivan") [[?e]]]
 [?e :crux.db/id]]}
----

The destructuring available is `entity-id`, `matched-value` and
`score`. For example, to return the full search results tuple:

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e ?v ?s]
 :where '[[(text-search :name "Ivan") [[?e ?v ?s]]]
 [?e :crux.db/id]]}
----

In the above example, `?e` is the entity ID of the matched search
rsult. `?v` is the matched value and `?s` is the matched score.

You can use standard Lucene fuzzy textual search capabilities:

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e]
 :where '[[(text-search :name "Iva*") [[?e]]]
 [?e :crux.db/id]]}
----

Will return all entities that with a `:name` that starts with
"Iva". See the Lucene documentation for more information.

It's possible to supply var bindings to use in `text-search`:

[source,clojure]
----
(c/q db '{:find  [?v]
          :in    [input]
          :where [[(text-search :name input) [[?e ?v]]]]}
     "Ivan")
----

== Wildcard Attributes

There is an an experimental wildcard search function, where you can
search across all attributes:

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e ?v ?a ?s]
 :where '[[(wildcard-text-search "Iva*") [[?e ?v ?a ?s]]]
 [?e :crux.db/id]]}
----

Will return all entities that have an attribute with a value that
matches "Iva". The destructured binding also contains `a` which is the
matched attribute.

== Multi-field searches

There is an entirely different search-function available for
multi-field searches using Lucene in Crux: `lucene-text-search`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e]
 :where '[[(lucene-text-search "firstname:James OR surname:preston") [[?e]]]]}
----

This `lucene-text-search` takes a Lucene query string.

WARNING: If you use `lucene-text-search`, you cannot use the search
functions listed above - `wildcard-text-search` and
`text-search`. This is because the way we index documents into Lucene
is different.

NOTE: In the normal case for `text-search` and `wildcard-text-search`,
we index each A/V pair in a Crux document as individual documents in
Lucene. This allows for a large degree of structural sharing, which
will help in the case where there is a lot historical data in
Crux. This is targeted to ease the disk-space taken up by Lucene, but
also for query efficiency reasons.

NOTE: `lucene-text-search` indexs a single document per
document-version in Crux. The downside of this is structural sharing
impacting disk space, but the upside is taking advantage of more of
the Lucene query language capability, and to perform queries taking
into account multiple fields.

To enable `lucene-text-search`, you must configure the Lucene Indexer, such like:

[source,clojure]
----
{...
 :crux.lucene/lucene-store {:db-dir "lucene-dir" :indexer 'crux.lucene.multi-field/->indexer}}
----

=== Bindings

It's possible to supply var bindings also, that are wired in using
`format` when the vars are bound.

[source,clojure]
----
{:find '[?e]
 :where '[[(lucene-text-search "firstname:%s" ?surname) [[?e]]]
          [?e :firstname ?firstname]]}
----
